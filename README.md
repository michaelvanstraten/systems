# My Systems Repository

Welcome to my **Systems** repository, where I manage both my dotfiles and system
configurations using Nix Flakes. This repository represents an evolved version
of my previous
[dotfiles repository](https://github.com/michaelvanstraten/dotfiles), now
focusing on a more integrated and reproducible approach to system management.

## Overview

This repository leverages Nix Flakes to provide a declarative and reproducible
setup for both my personal and professional environments. It includes
configurations for various systems, including macOS and NixOS, ensuring a
consistent experience across different machines.

## Features

- **Nix Flakes**: Utilizes Nix Flakes for declarative and reproducible system
  configurations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both macOS and NixOS systems.
- **Integrated Management**: Combines dotfiles and system configurations into a
  single repository for easier management.
- **Automated Checks**: Includes pre-commit hooks for maintaining code quality
  and consistency.
